    A promise in JavaScript is exactly what it sounds like - you use it to make a promise to do something
    usually asynchronously,异步

    Promise is a constructor function
    so you need to use the new keyword to create one. 
    It takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - resolve and reject
    接受一个函数作为参数,resolve和reject
    to determine the outcome of the promise
    决定promise的结果
    const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

    });
